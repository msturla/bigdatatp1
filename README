==========

This directory must be copied to a datanode.

Once that is done, use:

./setup.sh

to setup scripts. You can now run any script with pig (pig $filename) 
with any file in the scripts folder.

You can also invoke

./run_scripts.sh

to run all scripts sequentially.

Results of the scripts will be uploaded to hadoop fs, in /user/hadoop/results
