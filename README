==========

This directory must be copied to a datanode.

Once that is done, use:

./setup.sh

to setup scripts. You can now run any script with pig (pig $filename) 
with any file in the scripts folder.

You can also invoke

./run_all.sh

to run all scripts sequentially. You may have to give execution permission to these files.

Also

./run_script.sh filename

will run an individual script.

Results of the scripts will be uploaded to hadoop fs, in /user/hadoop/results

At the time of writing, you can download the zip by using:

wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64978912/bigdatatp1.zip

and then:

unzip bigdatatp1.zip
